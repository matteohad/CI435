		<h2><a id="topic"></a>Choosing my topic</h2>
		<p>After looking at the topics available to write about, I decided to cover the topic of referencing, this is because I have not previously had to use references in pieces of work that I have created.</p> 
		<p>I found this hard to do at first, but I feel like as I have been doing it I have become more comfortable and familiar with what needs to be there and how to correctly cite sources of information that I have used.</p>
		<h2><a id="referencing"></a>Referencing</h2>
		<p>As I've come to understand, the process of referencing is important in any piece of academic work. This is to highlight where external sources of information or works are being referred to, when it is not an original thought or an opinion. This also allows myself to think of the bigger picture when it comes to talking about the topic of work.</p>
		<p>For example, in my 'Working in the Computing Industry' module I chose to write about the use of AI in autonomous vehicles, I used referencing to not only highlight the positives but also the negatives associated with these vehicles, such as the ethical complications that they pose. This actually helped me to reach my conclusion and helped to define my own opinion on the subject.</p>
		<p>I've also shown my use of referencing on my Learning Journal webpage, at the bottom under the heading 'References'. I used the website <a href="https://www.citethemrightonline.com">https://www.citethemrightonline.com</a> in order to find the correct format of referencing I needed for each separate reference.</p>
		<h2><a id="reflecting"></a>Reflecting on Semester One</h2>
		<p>I started the course late, meaning that when I enrolled I had around 5/6 weeks of work to catch up on, this proved to be a task, whilst I was also settling in to Brighton. Despite this, I rather enjoyed having a lot of work to do, before burning out a little before Christmas. Looking back, I would have done things slightly differently, I would've liked to spent more time focusing on getting my assignments completed more consistently as opposed to taking breaks between each one.</p>
		<p>All in all, I enjoyed my first semester, and I look forward to delving deeper into modules in the second semester.</p>
