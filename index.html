			</header>
			<p>This week I worked on the "Contact Me" page, this includes a HTML form, I followed the tutorial in order to populate this page. I also started to look at what to include on the Tutorial webpage.</p>
			<p>I added a favicon to my webpages, I searched google to find out how to do this, I used the W3C website to find out how to do this.</p>
			<p>Looking back on the work that I have created for this module, I feel that I am mostly happy with what I have created. I say mostly happy as I feel that there are certain elements, such as the design aspect of my page that I could have spent more time working on. I feel that when I was presented with issues while creating my webpages I could efficiently solve them, this aspect I did enjoy, even when it took more time than I thought necessary to fix them, I enjoyed figuring them out.</p>

			</header>
				<p>In this week I spent time making changes to my CSS to make my webpage more responsive. I found an issue with my table in that it wouldn't display the table up to the edge of the element, I researched online how to fix this but I could not find  the specific fix that I was looking for. As I am working on my code using Visual Studio Code, I tried messing around with some of the suggestions that come up when I am typing my code. After testing several of these out and failing to find a fix I found an option that worked once I refreshed my webpage, this was having 'table-layout: auto' under the table element in my CSS.</p>

				<h3><a id="week5"></a>Week 5: Making my webpage responsive</h3>
				<p class="publish">Published on <time datetime="2023-11-14"><strong>November 14, 2023</strong></time></p>
			</header>
				<p>This week I focused on making my webpage responsive so that it would work across different devices, starting with mobile first design. I chose to do a mobile first approach to design as this is the accepted standard that web designers tend to use these days. This is because the greater majority of web traffic is done by mobile users in recent years, with 2022 containing the highest share of web traffic coming from mobile users at 59.66%, and mobile traffic making up over 50% of the web traffic share annually since 2017 (Unadkat, 2023).</p>

				<h3><a id="week4"></a>Week 4: Learning CSS styling</h3>
				<p class="publish">Publised on <time datetime="2023-11-07"><strong>November 7, 2023</strong></time></p>
		</header>
			<p>This week I started formatting my own CSS stylesheet for my webpage, this included using the normalize.css and stylesheet.css templates and adapting them to suit the style I was going for.</p>
			<p>I researched into the differences between Normalize CSS and CSS Reset. From this I have learnt that Normalize CSS allows for cross-browser uniformity when styling HTML. Chrome, Safari and Firefox use the same styles. However, Internet Explorer and Edge use different styles. This means that normalize.css conforms to the IE/Edge styling and apply this to the rest of the browsers. 
			<p>Reset.css takes a different approach to how these styles are applied, this will reset the styles in all browsers, and takes the styles from the project itself. CSS Resets are big chains of code that are difficult to read while debugging. </p>
			<p>I have learnt the differences in the types of font that can be used when using CSS (Duckett, 2011). My main findings from this were that sans-serif typefaces are easier to read if the size of the text is smaller, this will be something that I will implement into my webpage. According to this book, the default size of text in web browsers is 16px, upon learning this, I have decided to use this type size as the standard for my webpage, I will be making my body text this size, then scaling up for headings.</p>

				<p>Mozilla Developer defines HTML as follows:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

				<p>I have been learning the basics of HTML, using HTML tags to structure text onto a webpage.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>In this week I learnt - 
						<ul>
							<li>How to write tables into HTML.</li>
							<li>How to make an image into a link. As utilised above with the HTML5 logo.</li>
							<li>How to create a description list.</li>
							<li>How to add quoted text to HTML.</li>
							<li>How to create nested lists within lists.</li>	
							
						</ul>		
					</li>
					<li>In this week I also - 
						<ul>
							<li>Researched into links, I found that people will generally have a more positive experience if text links are clear, as well as helping people who may be using screen reader software (Reference 7).</li> 
							<li>Found an error using the W3C validation tool, so I went back and fixed my errors before saving my work and moving on.</li>

				<p> In this week I - </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Learnt how to insert publication dates onto my webpage.</li>
					<li>Learnt how to insert ordered and unordered lists into posts.</li>
					<li>Learnt how to create navigation links within my webpage using anchors.</li>
					<li>Learnt how to add an email link into my webpage.</li>
					<li>Researched into block and inline elements, block level elements are essentially paragraphs, these start new lines stacking vertically down the page(&lt;p&gt; is an example of a block element). Inline elements are displayed in a line, hence the name, several of these can be displated on a single row(&lt;a&gt; is an example of an inline element). This is referenced as Reference 3.</li>
					<li>Discovered that when I inserted my image for Week 2, I missed a &gt; at the end of my line of code, I found this on the HTML validation tool.</li>
					<li>Learnt how to insert symbols using HTML entities such as &gt; and &lt;.</li>

			</header>
				<p>In this week I learnt the basics of HTML. I created 3 webpages, and I started to populate these with relevant information. I completed these actions - </p>
				<ol>
					<li>I set up files and folders for the relevant sections in my own <em>workspace area</em> on Brighton Domains.</li>
					<li>I set up relative links between the 3 pages in a navigation menu, along with absolute links in my references.</li>
					<li>I constantly checked that the webpages were functioning as intended using the Run and Debug function within Visual Studio Code.	</li>
					<li>I inserted an image into my web page, the image was too large at first so I researched how to make it smaller, the website I used to learn how to do this is Reference 1.</li>
					<li>I also validated my <strong>HTML</strong> code using the <em>W3C</em> validation tool (Reference 2).</li>
